	abstract = {We present an interactive user interface that allows digital marketing professionals to have real time access to insights from a back-end AI that predicts potential click-through rates of composed content based on similar past campaigns. We wanted to investigate the extent to which digital marketing professionals would find our system usable and useful and whether or not the advice our system generated would create content that had higher click through rates than content developed without the system’s advice. Our framework decomposes aspects of prior campaigns into features including image quality, memorability, and placement; and text readability, formality and sentiment. We show our algorithm has high predictive value on a historical test set (AUC .80); that digital marketing professionals give the system an overall high satisfaction rating and that, using the advice of the AI agent, we can generate content that creates up to 22\% click-through rate lift on a 700 A/B preference tasks given to master workers on AMT.},

The goal of price prediction is to help sellers set effective and reasonable prices for their second-hand items with the images and text descriptions uploaded to the online platforms. Specifically, we design a multi-modal price suggestion system which takes as input the extracted visual and textual features along with some statistical item features collected from the second-hand item shopping platform to determine whether the image and text of an uploaded second-hand item are qualified for reasonable price suggestion with a binary classification model, and provide price suggestions for second-hand items with qualified images and text descriptions with a regression model. To satisfy different demands, two different constraints are added into the joint training of the classification model and the regression model. Moreover, a customized loss function is designed for optimizing the regression model to provide price suggestions for second-hand items, which can not only maximize the gain of the sellers but also facilitate the online transaction. We also derive a set of metrics to better evaluate the proposed price suggestion system. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal price suggestion system.},

	abstract = {In modern online advertising systems, the click-through rate (CTR) is an important index to measure the popularity of an item. It refers to the ratio of users who click on a specific advertisement to the number of total users who view it. Predicting the CTR of an item in advance can improve the accuracy of the advertisement recommendation. And it is commonly calculated based on users’ interests. Thus, extracting users’ interests is of great importance in CTR prediction tasks. In the literature, a lot of studies treat the interaction between users and items as sequential data and apply the recurrent neural network (RNN) model to extract users’ interests. However, these solutions cannot handle the case when the sequence length is relatively long, e.g., over 100. This is because of the vanishing gradient problem of RNN, i.e., the model cannot learn a users’ previous behaviors that are too far away from the current moment. To address this problem, we propose a new Core Interest Network (CIN) model to mitigate the problem of a long sequence in the CTR prediction task with sequential data. In brief, we first extract the core interests of users and then use the refined data as the input of subsequent learning tasks. Extensive evaluations on real dataset show that our CIN model can outperform the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate prediction plays an important role in many fields, such as recommender and advertising systems. It is one of the crucial parts to improve user experience and increase industry revenue. Recently, several deep learning-based models are successfully applied to this area. Some existing studies further model user representation based on user historical behavior sequence, in order to capture dynamic and evolving interests. We observe that users usually have multiple interests at a time and the latent dominant interest is expressed by the behavior. The switch of latent dominant interest results in the behavior changes. Thus, modeling and tracking latent multiple interests would be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel method named as Deep Multi-Interest Network (DMIN) which models user’s latent multiple interests for click-through rate prediction task. Specifically, we design a Behavior Refiner Layer using multi-head self-attention to capture better user historical item representations. Then the Multi-Interest Extractor Layer is applied to extract multiple user interests. We evaluate our method on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed DMIN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of click-through rate prediction task.},

The prosperity of online campaigns is a challenge in online marketing and is usually evaluated by user response through different metrics, such as clicks on advertisement (ad) creatives, subscriptions to products, purchases of items, or explicit user feedback through online surveys. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of studies using computational approaches, including machine learning methods, for user response prediction. However, existing literature mainly focuses on algorithmic-driven designs to solve specific challenges, and no comprehensive review exists to answer many important questions. What are the parties involved in the online digital advertising eco-systems? What type of data are available for user response prediction? How do we predict user response in a reliable and/or transparent way? In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of user response prediction in online advertising and related recommender applications. Our essential goal is to provide a thorough understanding of online advertising platforms, stakeholders, data availability, and typical ways of user response prediction. We propose a taxonomy to categorize state-of-the-art user response prediction methods, primarily focusing on the current progress of machine learning methods used in different online platforms. In addition, we also review applications of user response prediction, benchmark datasets, and open source codes in the field.},

It is hard to design an appropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for different types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the delayed feedback problem in online advertising by “Following the Prophet” (FTP for short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the logged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the “prophet”. Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we show that we could predict the prophet’s predictions by an aggregation policy on top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the feedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and optimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the prophet. Extensive experiments on three real-world advertising datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is one of the most critical tasks for digital display advertising. Commercial systems often require to update models in an online learning manner to catch up with the evolving data distribution. However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after user clicks. This may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when conversion happens later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive experiments on a public data and a private industrial dataset. Experimental results conﬁrm that our method consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results.},

Although existing methods, typically built on the user sequential behavior path “impression→click→purchase”, is effective for dealing with SSB issue, they still struggle to address the DS issue due to rare purchase training samples. Observing that users always take several purchase-related actions after clicking, we propose a novel idea of post-click behavior decomposition. Specifically, disjoint purchase-related Deterministic Action (DAction) and Other Action (OAction) are inserted between click and purchase in parallel, forming a novel user sequential behavior graph “impression→click→D(O)Action→purchase”. Defining model on this graph enables to leverage all the impression samples over the entire space and extra abundant supervised signals from D(O)Action, which will effectively address the SSB and DS issues together. To this end, we devise a novel deep recommendation model named Elaborated Entire Space Supervised Multi-task Model (𝐸𝑆𝑀2). According to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph, it employs multi-task learning to predict some decomposed sub-targets in parallel and compose them sequentially to formulate the final CVR. Extensive experiments on both offline and online environments demonstrate the superiority of 𝐸𝑆𝑀2 over state-ofthe-art models. The source code and dataset will be released.},

It has two major challenges: ﬁrstly, the scarce user history data is very complicated and non-linear; secondly, the time delay between the clicks and the corresponding conversions can be very large, e.g., ranging from seconds to weeks. Existing models usually suffer from such scarce and delayed conversion behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework to tackle the two challenges. Speciﬁcally, we extract the pre-trained embedding from impressions/clicks to assist in conversion models and propose an inner/self-attention mechanism to capture the ﬁne-grained personalized product purchase interests from the sequential click data. Besides, to overcome the time-delay issue, we calibrate the delay model by learning dynamic hazard function with the abundant post-click data more in line with the real distribution. Empirical experiments with real-world user behavior data prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A successful conversion typically has the following sequential events: "exposure → click → conversion". Conventional CVR estimators are trained in the click space, but inference is done in the entire exposure space. They fail to account for the causes of the missing data and treat them as missing at random. Hence, their estimations are highly likely to deviate from the real values by large.

However, the performance of traditional machine learning models is often impacted due to variations in user and advertiser behavior. For example, search engine traffic for florists usually tends to peak around Valentine’s day, Mother’s day, etc. To overcome, this challenge, in this manuscript we propose three models which are able to incorporate the effects arising due to variations in product demand. The proposed models are a combination of product demand features, specialized data sampling methodologies and ensemble techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed models on datasets obtained from a real-world setting. Our results show that the proposed models more accurately predict the outcome of users interactions with product related advertisements while simultaneously being robust to fluctuations in user and advertiser behaviors.},

The mainstream methods map sparse, high-dimensional categorical features (e.g., user id, item id) into low-dimensional representations with neural networks. Although they have achieved significant advancement in recent years, how to capture user’s diverse interests effectively from past behaviors is still challenging. Recently some works try using attention-based methods to learn the representation from user behavior history adaptively. However, it is insufficient to capture the diversity of user’s interests. As a step forward to improve this goal, we propose a method named Attentive Capsule Network (ACN). It uses Transformers for feature interaction and leverages capsule networks to capture multiple interests from user behavior history. To precisely obtain sequence representation related to the current advertisement, we further design a modified dynamic routing algorithm integrating with an attention mechanism. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ACN with significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, it also offers good explainability when extracting diverse interest points of users from behavior history.},

The methods are based on a wellknown graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users’ behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao’s live production environment.},

	abstract = {Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction in modern industrial e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly important, which directly contributes to the final revenue. In order to address the wellknown sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) issues encountered during CVR modeling, the abundant labeled macro behaviors (𝑖.𝑒., user’s interactions with items) are used. Nonetheless, we observe that several purchase-related micro behaviors (𝑖.𝑒., user’s interactions with specific components on the item detail page) can supplement fine-grained cues for CVR prediction. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel CVR prediction method by Hierarchically Modeling both Micro and Macro behaviors (𝐻 𝑀3). Specifically, we first construct a complete user sequential behavior graph to hierarchically represent micro behaviors and macro behaviors as one-hop and two-hop post-click nodes. Then, we embody 𝐻 𝑀3 as a multi-head deep neural network, which predicts six probability variables corresponding to explicit sub-paths in the graph. They are further combined into the prediction targets of four auxiliary tasks as well as the final 𝐶𝑉 𝑅 according to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph. By employing multi-task learning and leveraging the abundant supervisory labels from micro and macro behaviors, 𝐻 𝑀3 can be trained end-to-end and address the SSB and DS issues. Extensive experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 𝐻 𝑀3 over representative state-of-the-art methods.},

Conventional CVR modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific problems in practice, making CVR modeling challenging. For example, conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions. This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this paper, we model CVR in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential pattern of user actions, i.e., impression → click → conversion. The proposed Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems simultaneously by i) modeling CVR directly over the entire space, ii) employing a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao’s recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this dataset to enable future research.

	abstract = {Estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately is crucial in E-commerce. However, CVR prediction usually suffers from three major challenges in practice: i) data sparsity: compared with impressions, conversion samples are often extremely scarce; ii) sample selection bias: conventional CVR models are trained with clicked impressions while making inference on the entire space of all impressions; iii) delayed feedback: many conversions can only be observed after a relatively long and random delay since clicks happened, resulting in many false negative labels during training. Previous studies mainly focus on one or two issues while ignoring the others. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework ESDF to tackle the above three challenges simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, ESDF models the CVR prediction from a perspective of entire space, and combines the advantage of user sequential behavior pattern and the time delay factor. Speciﬁcally, ESDF utilizes sequential behavior of user actions on the entire space with all impressions to alleviate the sample selection bias problem. By sharing the embedding parameters between CTR and CVR networks, data sparsity problem is greatly relieved. Different from conventional delayed feedback methods, ESDF does not make any special assumption about the delay distribution. We discretize the delay time by day slot and model the probability based on survival analysis with deep neural network, which is more practical and suitable for industrial situations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ESDF is the ﬁrst attempt to unitedly solve the above three challenges in CVR prediction area. More than that, we release a sampling version of industrial dataset to enable the future research, which is the ﬁrst public dataset that comprises impression, click and delayed conversion labels for CVR modeling.},

	abstract = {Predicting conversion rates (CVRs) in display advertising (e.g., predicting the proportion of users who purchase an item (i.e., a conversion) after its corresponding ad is clicked) is important when measuring the effects of ads shown to users and to understanding the interests of the users. There is generally a time delay (i.e., so-called delayed feedback) between the ad click and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted after an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this drawback, CVR prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential distribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee that the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best distribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for CVR prediction that represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a parametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution. Because the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content of an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be represented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can capture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when the distribution is complicated. Moreover, on a real dataset, we show that the proposed model outperforms the existing method that assumes an exponential distribution for the time delay in terms of conversion rate prediction.},

Predicting this conversion rate is thus essential for estimating the value of an impression and can be achieved via machine learning. One diﬃculty however is that the conversions can take place long after the impression – up to a month – and this delayed feedback hinders the conversion modeling. We tackle this issue by introducing an additional model that captures the conversion delay. Intuitively, this probabilistic model helps determining whether a user that has not converted should be treated as a negative sample – when the elapsed time is larger than the predicted delay – or should be discarded from the training set – when it is too early to tell. We provide experimental results on real traﬃc logs that demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.},

The findings come from a new survey by Adobe which also found that companies spending more on optimization are reaping the benefits.
The Adobe 2013 Digital Marketing Optimization Survey, with analysis carried out by Econsultancy, received global responses from more than 1,800 digital marketers across North America, Europe and Asia.
It explores the key areas in which digital marketers need to excel to ensure success, including mobile, social, personalisation and customer experience.},

	title = {Addressing {Delayed} {Feedback} for {Continuous} {Training} with {Neural} {Networks} in {CTR} prediction},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06558},
	abstract = {One of the challenges in display advertising is that the distribution of features and click through rate (CTR) can exhibit large shifts over time due to seasonality, changes to ad campaigns and other factors. The predominant strategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models continuously, on fresh data, in order to prevent them from becoming stale. However, in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly long and random delay. These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested by the training algorithm. Naive strategies which consider any data point a negative example until a positive label becomes available tend to underestimate CTR, resulting in inferior user experience and suboptimal performance for advertisers. The focus of this paper is to identify the best combination of loss functions and models that enable large-scale learning from a continuous stream of data in the presence of delayed labels. In this work, we compare 5 different loss functions, 3 of them applied to this problem for the first time. We benchmark their performance in offline settings on both public and proprietary datasets in conjunction with shallow and deep model architectures. We also discuss the engineering cost associated with implementing each loss function in a production environment. Finally, we carried out online experiments with the top performing methods, in order to validate their performance in a continuous training scheme. While training on 668 million in-house data points offline, our proposed methods outperform previous state-of-the-art by 3\% relative cross entropy (RCE). During online experiments, we observed 55\% gain in revenue per thousand requests (RPMq) against naive log loss.},
