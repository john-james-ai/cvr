    "# Introduction\n",
    "Digital advertising, a \\$374.2 billion market {cite}`marketsGlobalDigitalAdvertising2021`, delivers advertising and promotional content to users through a range of online and digital channels such as search engines, mobile- apps, social media, email, and websites. Yet, digital marketing expenditures are expected to yield a predictable and positive return on investment (ROI) in terms of sales. Conversion rate, arguably the leading predictor of ROI, is defined as the number of conversions per visitor, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CVR}=\\frac{\\text{Number of Conversions}}{\\text{Number of Visitors}}* 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, investment in conversion rate optimization (CRO), the process of increasing the percentage of conversions, is significant and for good reason. It pays off! The proportion of marketing spend allocated to conversion optimization positively correlates with higher conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "|     Average Conversion Rate    |     Up to 25%    |     More than 25%    |\n",

    "\n",
    "These data {cite}`mothMostCompaniesSpend2013` show that CRO spending has its benefits. Firms investing over 25% of their marketing budgets on CRO are twice as likely to enjoy greater conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the explosive growth of customer behavior data has stimulated a need for efficient and effective computational methods to understand, influence, and predict customer behavior. To address this need, research and industry have developed a range of deep learning and machine learning approaches to tackle this problem; including supervised and unsupervised neural networks, ensemble methods, factorization machines, and others. Yet, predicting user behavior in a real-time, data-intensive, context has its challenges {cite}`gharibshahUserResponsePrediction2021`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t**Scalability**: Of the 7.7 billion people in the world, 3.5 billion are online {cite}`owidinternet` and most of us will encounter between 4,000 and 10,000 per day {cite}`simpsonCouncilPostFinding`. The top 10 online advertisers of 2020 generated over 90 billion impressions in the 1st quarter alone {cite}`TopOnlineAdvertisers`. Machine learning approaches to predict user response must be built to scale.\n",
    "-\t**Conversion Rarity**: Median conversion rates for eCommerce are in the range of 2.35% to 5.31% across all industries {cite}`WhatGoodConversion2014`, still average conversion rate among eCommerce companies fall between 1.84% and 3.71% {cite}`EcommerceConversionRates2022`.\n",
    "-\t**Data Sparsity**: Two factors contribute to the sparsity of data. First, most of the input data are binary representations of categorical features, resulting in high-dimensional vectors with few non-zero values. Second user interactions follow the power-law distribution whereby the majority of users are interacting with a relatively small number of items or products.\n",
    "-\t**Delayed Conversion Feedback**: Though the time between an ad impression and a click may be seconds, the time delay between a click and a conversion could be hours, days, or longer. Today, machine learning solutions must be able to predict in the context of this delayed feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep-CVR explores state-of-the-art deep learning methods to improve conversion rate prediction for the online advertising industry. Starting with baseline logistic regression models, weâ€™ll explore supervised techniques such as factorization machines, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and neural attention network architectures."
